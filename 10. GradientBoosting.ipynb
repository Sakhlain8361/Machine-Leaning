    "- Typically, decision trees with limited depth (shallow trees) are used as weak learners. These trees are simple models that can only capture basic patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.Loss Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The loss function measures how well the model fits the training data. Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and Log Loss for classification.\n",
    "Gradient Boosting optimizes the loss function by reducing the error at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.Additive Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting constructs the final model by iteratively adding weak learners. Each weak learner corrects the errors of the previous model, gradually improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.Learning Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The learning rate (η) controls the contribution of each tree to the final model. Smaller values lead to more gradual learning, requiring more iterations but often resulting in better generalization.\n"
